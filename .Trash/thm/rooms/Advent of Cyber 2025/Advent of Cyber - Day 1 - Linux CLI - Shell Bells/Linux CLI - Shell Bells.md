There are three hidden easter eggs.
They combine to form the passcode to open my encrypted vault

Clues (one for each egg):
1) I ride with your session, not with your chest of files. Open the little bag your shell carries when you arrive. 
2) The tree shows today; the rings remember yesterday. Read the ledger's older pages.
3) When pixels sleep, their tails sometimes whisper plain words. Listen to the tail. 

Find the fragments, join them in order, and use the resulting passcode to decrypt the message I left. Be careful -- I had to be quick, and I left only enough to get help.
