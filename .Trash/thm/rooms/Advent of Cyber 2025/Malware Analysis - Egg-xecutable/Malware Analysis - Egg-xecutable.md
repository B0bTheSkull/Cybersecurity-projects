summary: Malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file to understand its functionality, operation, and methods for defence against it. By analysing a malicious file or application, we can see exactly how it operates, and therefore, know how to prevent it. For example, could the malicious file communicate with an attacker's server? We can block that server.

## Introduction
Malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file to understand its functionality, operation, and methods for defence against it. By analysing a malicious file or application, we can see exactly how it operates, and therefore, know how to prevent it. For example, could the malicious file communicate with an attacker's server? We can block that server.
## Content

There are two main branches of malware analysis:
- Static analysis focuses on inspecting a file without executing it
- Dynamic analysis focuses on inspecting the file post execution and seeing how it interacts with the machine etc.

### Sandboxes
In cyber security, sandboxes are used to execute potentially dangerous code. Think of this as disposable digital play-pens. These sandboxes are safe, isolated environments where potentially malicious applications can perform their actions without risking sensitive data or impacting other systems.
